# Study Summary

## Hypothesis

**from draft IRB form**:

> When people search for information via a dialogue UI (e.g. a chatbot), that they will be more likely to use language which divulges more personal information about themselves compared to using a traditional search engine query.


**from draft prereg paper:**

>I hypothesize that study participants performing information retrieval (IR) tasks with a conversational user interface (CUI) will divulge more personally-identifiable information (PII) about themselves than participants interacting with a simple text input field.
>
> Further, I predict that CUIs will encourage participants to use more verbose natural language than if they were presented with a text input field, in turn yielding more opportunities to disclose PII. Responses to the CUI may contain direct disclosures, presuppositions, or no PII.
>
> Moreover, I predict that the verbose natural language encouraged by conversational agents will allow natural language inference (NLI) systems to profile participants more reliably than their peers using text input fields.
