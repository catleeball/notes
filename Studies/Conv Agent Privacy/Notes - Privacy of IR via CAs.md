# Study Summary

## Hypothesis

**from draft IRB form**:

> When people search for information via a dialogue UI (e.g. a chatbot), that they will be more likely to use language which divulges more personal information about themselves compared to using a traditional search engine query.


**from draft prereg paper:**

>I hypothesize that study participants performing information retrieval (IR) tasks with a conversational user interface (CUI) will divulge more personally-identifiable information (PII) about themselves than participants interacting with a simple text input field.
>
> Further, I predict that CUIs will encourage participants to use more verbose natural language than if they were presented with a text input field, in turn yielding more opportunities to disclose PII. Responses to the CUI may contain direct disclosures, presuppositions, or no PII.
>
> Moreover, I predict that the verbose natural language encouraged by conversational agents will allow natural language inference (NLI) systems to profile participants more reliably than their peers using text input fields.


## Brief study plan

- Between-groups survey with IR tasks for participants
	- Tasks are fictional scenarios that prompt the participant to search for info online
		- *"You have a new pet bippo, but you don't know what to feed it. What would you type into the tool pictured below?"*
	- Experimental group gets picture of CUI
	- Control group gets picture of a text field
	- Text box for entry
	- Collect some demographic info too possibly
- Analysis
	- For each question, count personal information divulgences via:
		- direct statement
		- presupposition
		- if enough participants, maybe aggregate into per-participant rates since each participant could have widely varying rates of divulgences
			- this would lose maybe interesting data per-question if one question elicits more divulgences than other
	- Chi-squared hypothesis test for all data lumped together
	- Not sure how to analyze per-demographic!
		- ... more chi-squared tests per demographic?
		- compare with confidence intervals to other demographics?
		- this would be a whole lot of comparisons


# TODO

- done:
	- prereg report: https://www.overleaf.com/project/64693bd0f478397fc79bfca7
	- confirm no financial conflict of interest
	- sent [[IRB]] forms for review
- in progress:
	- write survey https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nKzlsQ0-2zf3m-cFowTDH97Q_nZjB2sHYsZhIvPNKSg/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true
