Subject: Participate in Research on Information Retrieval via Conversational Agents - [Brief Survey]


Hello,

I'm a grad student seeking volunteers to fill out a quick survey (<=10 mins) about how you use different kinds of search interfaces.

I'm doing this work with the Computational Linguistics department to understand how language may vary when people perform searches with different user interfaces and what this means for people.

Surveys won't ask any personally identifiable information and will remain confidential.

Your help is greatly appreciated! Thank you so much for helping with this research!

Thanks,
Cat
