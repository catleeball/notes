### Preamble

With the exception of holiday names and a few other words which have officially recognized English spellings—e.g., Hasid, rebbe, Torah—Yiddish terms appear in this book in italics and are spelled according to the YIVO transcription of their pronunciation in standard Yiddish. In some cases where the words may also be familiar to readers by another spelling, that spelling is given in parentheses at the beginning of the definition, as is the word’s literal meaning, where pertinent.

The main principle of the transcription system is that each letter \(or fixed combination of two letters in the case of diphthongs and consonant clusters\) represents a single sound. Consonants have roughly the same sound as they do in English; vowels, diphthongs, and consonant clusters are pronounced according to the chart below. Note that there are no “silent” letters. Thus, when you see an *e* at the end of the Yiddish word *bime*, for example, remember that the word has two syllables and does not rhyme with the English word “dime.” Polysyllabic words in Yiddish are usually accented on the next-to-last syllable. When the stress falls elsewhere in a Yiddish term, it is indicated in the glossary with an accent mark.
